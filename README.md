# Getting Started

### About the Project

The Product Management System (PMS) is a web-based application designed to manage product information, track inventory, and streamline the workflow of managing products from creation to distribution. It provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for users to perform tasks like adding new products, editing existing ones, and keeping track of stock levels. This project aims to help businesses improve their product management processes and ensure they stay organized and efficient.

### Features

- **Add/Update/Delete Products:** Easily manage the details of each product, including name, description, category, price, and inventory levels.
- **Inventory Tracking:** Track stock levels in real-time and set alerts for low stock.
- **Product Search & Filtering:** Quickly find products by name, category, or other attributes.
- **User Management:** Manage different user roles (admin, manager, etc.) to ensure proper access control.
- **Reports and Analytics:** Generate reports to track sales, inventory levels, and performance.

### Upcoming in version pms2.0.0v

- **Multi-Language Support:** Allow users to choose their preferred language for the interface, enabling broader accessibility.
- **Product Import/Export:** Simplify the process of adding large amounts of product data by allowing bulk import and export through CSV or Excel files.
- **Enhanced Reporting:** Provide advanced reporting capabilities, such as customizable date ranges, product performance tracking, and exportable charts.
- **Improved User Interface:** A redesigned UI for better navigation and user experience, including a more intuitive layout and smoother interactions.
- **Advanced Role-based Permissions:** More granular control over user permissions, allowing admins to set detailed access rights for different user roles.
- **Mobile App Integration:** Integration with mobile apps to provide a seamless experience for users on the go.
- **Automated Stock Replenishment:** Enable automatic stock replenishment alerts and ordering to prevent stockouts.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Improve the performance and speed of the application, particularly for larger product inventories.
